# GraphCpp

The code presented here has elements from the videotutorials called "Software Engineering" by <b> David Owensd </b>.
It's slightly modified.

<h1><b> Features: </h1></b>

<ul>
  <li> The graph can be directed/undirected. </li>
  <li> The graph can be weighted or not. </li>
  <li> Able to print the graph. </li>
  <li> Dijkstra algorithm implemented (only works with weighted, directed/undirected graph).  
</ul>

The code still in development, it can contain bugs.
